                Hello, I'm Jamie. I am a Front End Developer. Though I know the basics of JavaScript I'm still learning
                the more intermediate/advanced aspects of JavaScript along with Sass, Git/GitHub, and jQuery. To
                further my skills I will later learn node.js and React.js and all that they require. I will continue to
                further my skills and learn some other languages for professional as well as personal reasons.

            <h3>How I Got Into Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                I took my first web development class back in 2012. It was an Intro to Internet/Web class. I was looking
                for electives for Fall semester. There wasn't many to choose from. In 2014, I had changed my major from
                Business Administration to Web Technologies.
            </p>

                Hello, I'm Jamie. I am a Front End Developer. Though I know the basics of JavaScript I am still learning
                the more intermediate/advanced aspects of JavaScript. Along with JavaScript,  I am learning Sass,
                Git/GitHub, and jQuery. After I have a solid understanding of these, I will go on to learn node and
                react and all that they require. To further my skills, I will learn some other languages/technologies
                for both my professional and personal development.

                How did I get into web development? Well, it was not intentional. It started back in 2012. I was looking
                for electives for Fall semester. I came across an Intro to Internet/Web class. I had never give any
                thought to how websites were made. I was interested so I enrolled. In the Summer of 2013,  I found
                myself going through the textbook again and learning more HTML and CSS.  In 2014, I decided to change my
                major from Business Administration to Web Technologies and took a few more classes. When it came time
                for me to learn JavaScript, I felt that I was not ready. (I was wary of JavaScript. I did not want to
                believe or accept that I had to learn JavaScript.) Since 2015, I have been teaching myself web
                development with various online resources.  When I was "ready" to learn JavaScript it did not go well.
                It was hard for me to find really good learning resources for JavaScript and I had gotten a little
                discouraged. It was not until recently that I found quality learning resources and began to really
                understand it.

                I am looking forward to learning all that I develop a desire and/or need to learn and to the apps,
                software, and websites, maybe even a game, that I will make.
