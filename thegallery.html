        This is The Gallery. The Gallery is a mock website. It was made just for practice. The gallery is a responsive
        website made using HTML5, CSS3, and some JavaScript. I used Adobe XD for wireframing and to try out different
        layouts.

        While this is just a simple, one-page website I wanted to do something different. Rather that put the website
        title in the center of the header, I decided to put it at the bottom of the header. The header container is
        also fixed on larger screens so that the navigation, which shows alongside the title on larger screens, so that
        it will be easily accessed.
